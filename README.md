burp_extensions
  
- burp_random_token_generator.py

```
This is similar to https://github.com/portswigger/token-incrementor but 
doesn't work well for my test.
This is because Token Incrementor adds the Incremented text to every new 
token which might affect the testing.
Burp Extension in Python makes it easier to modify.
